1. in Google docs, there is an annoying shortcut that prevents my keyboard layout to input character : alt-w (on macos).
I want to write a GreaseMonkey script that runs on docs.google.com so that : when the w is pressed either by itself or as part of a combination ie alt-w, the event is not process by the Google Docs  program and instead the character represented by alt-w is output normally like it would anywhere else.


2. this does not work : no log is ever output.
a stackoverflow qa from 2010 had :

Editing in Google Docs uses an iframe. You need to attach a listener to the iframe's document. It seems to do something complicated with the iframe I haven't yet been able to work out fully, but the following seems to work for Firefox:

var iframe = document.getElementsByTagName("iframe")[0];
if (iframe) {
iframe.contentDocument.addEventListener("keypress", function(evt) {
console.log("iframe keypress: " + evt.which);
}, false);
}

doesn't seem to make any difference now in 2025. But Google Docs keyboard handling might be more complex than what you wrote
